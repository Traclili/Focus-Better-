How does it work? You pick a subject that you want to study, and the timer goes off for 25 minutes, and then you can start working on that task. Then take a five-minute break to procrastinate. After four focused work meetings, have a longer 30-minute break to help you reduce burnout and stay focused on your busy day. Use Siri to control apps to make learning easier!

The application provides complete customization. All times, session lengths, and daily goals can be changed to your liking. The default value is just a suggestion, use what works for you!

Statistical tracking can help you understand how you focus on your work and when you work. And you can use it to brag about how hard you work.
Come and enjoy it
